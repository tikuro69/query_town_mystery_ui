# Query Town Mystery - Web UI

This project is a lightweight, browser-based version of the original Query Town Mystery CLI game.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. View the illustration at the top and use the terminal area at the bottom to type SQL-like commands.
3. Results are currently simulated for educational purposes.

## File Structure

- `index.html` — Main layout for the page.
- `styles.css` — Visual styling, including the terminal look.
- `script.js` — Very small script that prints simulated query responses.
- `static/engineer_detectives.png` — Placeholder illustration path. Add your own image here to enhance the storybook feel.

Feel free to extend these files or swap the assets with your own.
